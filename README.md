# Flappy Bird Clone

A simple Flappy Bird game implemented using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

-   Classic Flappy Bird gameplay mechanics.
-   Score tracking.
-   Basic collision detection.

## Technologies Used

-   HTML5 Canvas for rendering.
-   CSS for styling.
-   JavaScript for game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

-   Use the spacebar or mouse click to make the bird flap its wings and fly upwards.
-   Navigate the bird through gaps in the pipes to score points.
-   Avoid colliding with the pipes or the ground.

## Design Considerations

-   **Game Loop:** Implement a robust game loop for smooth animation and updates.
-   **Object-Oriented Structure:** Organize game elements (bird, pipes, background) into classes for better code maintainability and scalability.
-   **Collision Detection:** Refine collision detection for a more polished user experience. Consider using bounding boxes for accuracy.
-   **User Interface:** Design a clean and intuitive user interface for game start, score display, and game over screens.
-   **Responsiveness:** Ensure the game is playable and visually appealing on different screen sizes. Consider using relative units and media queries.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize rendering and game logic for smooth performance, especially on mobile devices.

## Future Enhancements

-   **Sound Effects and Music:** Add sound effects for actions like flapping, scoring, and collisions, and background music to enhance the game experience.
-   **Visual Improvements:**
    -   Implement parallax scrolling for the background.
    -   Add bird animations (flapping wings).
    -   Introduce visual effects like particle effects for collisions.
-   **Scoreboard:** Implement a high score system, potentially using local storage to persist scores.
-   **Difficulty Levels:** Introduce different difficulty settings by adjusting pipe spacing, bird speed, or pipe speed.
-   **Character Customization:** Allow players to choose different bird skins or characters.
-   **Themed Backgrounds:** Offer different background themes to change the visual environment of the game.
-   **Mobile Controls:** Implement touch controls for mobile devices for a better mobile gaming experience.
